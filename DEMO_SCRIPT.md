## Video Structure

### Opening (0:00 - 0:30)
**[Screen: Project README on GitHub]**

"Hello! I'm presenting my Electronix AI Sentiment Analysis microservice - a complete end-to-end solution for binary sentiment analysis built with modern technologies."

**Key Points to Mention:**
- FastAPI backend with Hugging Face Transformers
- TypeScript frontend with real-time predictions
- Docker containerization
- Fine-tuning capabilities

### Tech Stack Overview (0:30 - 1:00)
**[Screen: Architecture diagram or code structure]**

"The architecture consists of three main components:

1. **Backend**: FastAPI with Python, using CardiffNLP's Twitter RoBERTa model
2. **Frontend**: TypeScript with Vite, providing a beautiful responsive UI
3. **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose for easy deployment and development"

**[Screen: Show project structure]**
- Point out key files: main.py, finetune.py, docker-compose.yml
- Highlight the clean, organized structure

### Docker Build Process (1:00 - 1:30)
**[Screen: Terminal showing Docker commands]**

"Let me demonstrate the build process. Starting with Docker Compose:"

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**While building, explain:**
- Multi-stage Docker builds for optimization
- Automatic dependency installation
- Health checks and service orchestration
- Model loading process

**[Screen: Show Docker logs]**
- Point out model loading time (~5.7 seconds)
- Health check confirmations
- Service startup sequence

### Application Demo (1:30 - 2:15)
**[Screen: Frontend application at localhost:3000]**

"Now let's see the application in action:"

**Demo Flow:**
1. **Show the UI**: "Clean, responsive interface with real-time status"
2. **Test Positive Sentiment**: 
   - Input: "I absolutely love this amazing product!"
   - Show result: POSITIVE with confidence score
3. **Test Negative Sentiment**:
   - Input: "This is terrible and completely useless"
   - Show result: NEGATIVE with confidence score
4. **Show API Documentation**: Navigate to localhost:8000/docs
   - Demonstrate interactive Swagger UI
   - Show available endpoints

### Fine-tuning Demonstration (2:15 - 2:45)
**[Screen: Terminal showing fine-tuning process]**

"One of the key features is custom model fine-tuning:"

```bash
python finetune.py --data data/sample_data.jsonl --epochs 2 --lr 3e-5
```

**While running (or showing pre-recorded):**
- Explain the training process
- Show training metrics (loss, accuracy)
- Mention the 100% accuracy achieved on sample data
- Point out automatic model saving

**[Screen: Show model files]**
- Navigate to model/ directory
- Show generated model files
- Explain automatic model loading

### Production Features (2:45 - 3:00)
**[Screen: Show additional features quickly]**

"Additional production-ready features include:"

1. **Model Quantization**: "4x smaller models, 2-4x faster inference"
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: "Unit tests and CI/CD pipeline"
3. **Performance Monitoring**: "Health checks and metrics"
4. **Documentation**: "Complete API docs and deployment guides"

**[Screen: GitHub Actions or test results]**
- Show CI/CD pipeline
- Mention automated testing and building

### Closing (3:00)
**[Screen: Project summary or GitHub repo]**

"This demonstrates a complete, production-ready sentiment analysis microservice with modern DevOps practices. Thank you for watching!"
